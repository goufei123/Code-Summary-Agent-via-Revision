The HA status STAYSECONDARY is used to force the secondary device stay as secondary independent of the state of the Primary device. For example, in an existing HA setup, the Primary node has to be upgraded and this process would take few seconds. During the upgradation, it is possible that the Primary node may suffer from a downtime for a few seconds. However, the Secondary should not take over as the Primary node. Thus, the Secondary node should remain as Secondary even if there is a failure in the Primary node.\nSTAYPRIMARY configuration keeps the node in primary state in case if it is healthy, even if the peer node was the primary node initially. If the node with STAYPRIMARY setting (and no peer node) is added to a primary node (which has this node as the peer) then this node takes over as the new primary and the older node becomes secondary. ENABLED state means normal HA operation without any constraints/preferences.

This may result in a null tree.\n<li><code>excise &#60;name1&#62; &#60;name2&#62;</code>\n  The name1 node should either dominate or be the same as the name2 node.  This excises out everything from\nname1 to name2.  All the children of name2 go into the parent of name1, where name1 was.\n<li><code>relabel &#60;name&#62; &#60;new-label&#62;</code> Relabels the node to have the new label. <br>\nThere are three possible forms: <br>\n<code>relabel nodeX VP</code> - for changing a node label to an\nalphanumeric string <br>\n<code>relabel nodeX /''/</code> - for relabeling a node to\nsomething that isn't a valid identifier without quoting <br>\n\n<code>relabel nodeX /^VB(.*)$/verb\\\\/$1/</code> - for regular\nexpression based relabeling. In this case, all matches of the\nregular expression against the node label are replaced with the\nreplacement String.  This has the semantics of Java/Perl's\nreplaceAll: you may use capturing groups and put them in\nreplacements with $n. For example, if the pattern is /foo/bar/\nand the node matched is \"foo\", the replaceAll semantics result in\n\"barbar\".  If the pattern is /^foo(.*)$/bar$1/ and node matched is\n\"foofoo\", relabel will result in \"barfoo\".  <br>\n\nWhen using the regex replacement method, you can also use the\nsequences ={node} and %{var} in the replacement string to use\ncaptured nodes or variable strings in the replacement string.\nFor example, if the Tregex pattern was \"duck=bar\" and the relabel\nis /foo/={bar}/, \"foofoo\" will be replaced with \"duckduck\". <br>\n\nTo concatenate two nodes named in the tregex pattern, for\nexample, you can use the pattern /^.*$/={foo}={bar}/.  Note that\nthe ^.*$ is necessary to make sure the regex pattern only matches\nand replaces once on the entire node name. <br>\n\nTo get an \"=\" or a \"%\" in the replacement, using \\ escaping.\nAlso, as in the example you can escape a slash in the middle of\nthe second and third forms with \\\\/ and \\\\\\\\. <br>\n<li><code>insert &#60;name&#62; &#60;position&#62;</code> or <code>insert &lt;tree&gt; &#60;position&#62;</code>\n  inserts the named node or tree into the position specified.\n<li><code>move &#60;name&#62; &#60;position&#62;</code> moves the named node into the specified position\n<p>Right now the  only ways to specify position are:\n<p>\n     <code>$+ &#60;name&#62;</code>     the left sister of the named node<br>\n     <code>$- &#60;name&#62;</code>     the right sister of the named node<br>\n     <code>&gt;i</code> the i_th daughter of the named node<br>\n     <code>&gt;-i</code> the i_th daughter, counting from the right, of the named node.\n<li><code>replace &#60;name1&#62; &#60;name2&#62;</code> or <code>replace &#60;name1&#62; &#60;tree&#62;</code>\n    deletes name1 and inserts tree or a copy of name2 in its place.\n<li><code>adjoin &#60;auxiliary_tree&#62; &lt;name&gt;</code> Adjoins the specified auxiliary tree into the named node.\n    The daughters of the target node will become the daughters of the foot of the auxiliary tree.\n<li><code>adjoinH &#60;auxiliary_tree&#62; &lt;name&gt;</code> Similar to adjoin, but preserves the target node\n    and makes it the root of &lt;tree&gt;.
